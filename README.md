# Effects of upwelling (nitrate flux) on abundance of three genera of marine gelatinous medusae

## Steps for running analysis
1. Download the CSV files in the "data" folder
2. Import SJ_tools; this is the package containing functions necessary for analysis
3. Run "FinalProject.ipynb"

## Data location and sources
- Jellyfish abundance data was downloaded from NOAA's Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program (ERDDAP, link: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap/search/index.html?page=1&itemsPerPage=1000&searchFor=jellyfish+biomass). These data were collected as part of the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Surveys (RREAS) conducted by NOAA.
- BEUTI index data was downloaded from NOAA Environmental Research Data Services (ERD, link: https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/upwelling/dnld).

## Dependencies
Python packages needed to run analysis:
1. Numpy
2. MatPlotLib
3. Pandas
4. Pingouin
5. OS
6. DateTime
7. Scipy
8. SJ_tools (folder located in main branch of repo)

## Location of data
All data *necessary for statistical analysis* is provided in the "data" folder in the main branch of the repository

Raw data can be downloaded from ERD (BEUTI index) and ERDDAP (jelly abundance)
